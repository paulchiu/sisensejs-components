`@paulchiu/sjs-react`

This is a React component library that wraps Sisense.js to provide a cleaner and easier to use interface.

This package depends on `@paulchiu/sjs` so that needs to build first before this package can be built. Various demos/examples depend on this package so build this before running the demos.

```sh
yarn build
```
